# Refactoring

You've been asked to refactor the function `deterministicPartitionKey` in [`dpk.js`](dpk.js) to make it easier to read and understand without changing its functionality. For this task, you should:

1. Write unit tests to cover the existing functionality and ensure that your refactor doesn't break it. We typically use `jest`, but if you have another library you prefer, feel free to use it.
2. Refactor the function to be as "clean" and "readable" as possible. There are many valid ways to define those words - use your own personal definitions, but be prepared to defend them. Note that we do like to use the latest JS language features when applicable.
3. Write up a brief (~1 paragraph) explanation of why you made the choices you did and why specifically your version is more "readable" than the original.

You will be graded on the exhaustiveness and quality of your unit tests, the depth of your refactor, and the level of insight into your thought process provided by the written explanation.

## Your Explanation Here

I firstly ported the file to TypeScript so that data-types would be explicit and reduced the amount of ambiguity of the code. I then noticed that there were several if statements whose conditions could never be met, so I deleted those. I then noticed that the logic seemed to be written in a backwards way so I just turned the logic around and it reads much more nicely now. I then noticed some repetitious code so I externalized that bit into the `hashValue` function.
